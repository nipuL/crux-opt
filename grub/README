REQUIREMENTS

PRE-INSTALL
	    
POST-INSTALL

	Automatic setup using grub-install

	After installation you should create your own boot menu:

	# # Copy sample file
	# cp /boot/grub/menu.lst.sample /boot/grub/menu.lst
	# # Modify it for your system
	# vi /boot/grub/menu.lst

	For more information about setting up your own grub boot menu file:
	http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#Configuration

	After making your boot menu you should run grub-install like so:

	# grub-install /dev/sdX

	In the example above, X needs to be replaced with your hard drive.

	Manual setup

	After installation you need to copy the stage files to /boot/grub/:

	# cp /usr/share/grub/i386-pc/* /boot/grub/

	(Of course, you can choose another location as described above but this guide
	assumes that you use /boot/grub. Normally you need only the files stage1 and
	stage2. Please read the grub documentation if you don't know why:
	http://www.uruk.org/orig-grub/ and
	http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html)

	Now it's time to create your own "boot menu":

	# # Copy sample file
	# cp /boot/grub/menu.lst.sample /boot/grub/menu.lst
	# # Modify it for your system 
	# vi /boot/grub/menu.lst

	For more information about setting up your own grub boot menu file:
	http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#Configuration

	Last but not least, install/enable the boot manager:

	# # If the boot partition is mounted, you must specify --stage2, like below.
	# # Otherwise, you may remove this.
	# # Run grub
	# grub
	grub> root (hdX,Y)
	grub> setup --stage2=/boot/grub/stage2 (hdX)
	grub> quit

	Please correct the path and device names according to your configuration. Also
	see http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#Installation. In the
	example above, X and Y need to be replaced with your hard drive and grub
	partition.

	That's all. Good luck ;)	

PRECAUTION

	Installing a new boot manager is like modifying the partition table 
	or installing a new system kernel. Please create a rescue disk first :)
