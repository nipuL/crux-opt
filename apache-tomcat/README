README file for apache-tomcat port

CAUTION
This port is best suited for a test / developement environment; 
you should really use a dedicated local user for running the
tomcat server on a production environment.

NOTES
Starting from the 5.5.x series the default tomcat installation
requires Java 1.5; compatibilities addons are available, feel
free to provide them as a separate addon port.

The web administration interface is also removed from the
standard installation; again, if needed please provide it
through a dedicated port to avoid adding unnecessary stuff here.

POST-INSTALL
Set up your JAVA_HOME environment variable
pointing to j2sdk installation path
