README file for apache-tomcat port

NOTES FOR 5.5.17-2
  The port 5.5.17-2 introduces a couple of relevant changes:
  
  - Tomcat now runs under a 'tomcat' user instead of root.
    You may need to adjust permissions on custom config files
    under $TOMCAT_DIR/conf if you have created any.
  - The JAVA_HOME variable is now set in $TOMCAT_DIR/bin/setenv.sh,
    which is read by tomcat startup/shutdown scripts.

PRE-INSTALL
  Execute the pre-install script, or manually add a 'tomcat'
  user and group.

NOTES
  Starting from the 5.5.x series the default tomcat installation
  requires Java 1.5; compatibilities addons are available, feel
  free to provide them as a separate addon port.

  The web administration interface is also removed from the
  standard installation; again, if needed please provide it
  through a dedicated port to avoid adding unnecessary stuff here.

POST-INSTALL
  Set up a manager user/role in, $TOMCAT_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml, 
  ie:
    <tomcat-users>
      <user name="manager" password="verysecret" roles="manager" />
    </tomcat-users>
