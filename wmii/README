PRECAUTION

    The developers of wmii have changed the configuration format again.
    So wmii doesn't depend on base9 anymore. They switched back to the
    old sh configuration format. Therefore you have to manually convert
    your old configuration files (from 2.5) to use it in this new
    version (3.0).  The configuration paths also have been changed.

    ~/.wmii-3
    /etc/wmii-3
