REQUIREMENTS

    The wmii configuration scripts now rely on the 9base package which
    contains ports of various Plan 9 standard tools, in particular the
    rc shell. I've created a port of it.

PRE-INSTALL

POST-INSTALL

PRECAUTION

    I've added a patch to stop wmii warping the mouse around. If you
    like that feature just comment the patch out.

    The developer of wmii changed the configuration format again. You
    have to manually convert your old configuration to use it in this
    new version. The configuration paths also have been changed.

    ~/.wmii-2.5
    /etc/wmii-2.5
