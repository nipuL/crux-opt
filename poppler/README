Optional Dependencies:

gtk, and/or qt3

Note:

I built this against gtk and qt3.  Should you omit the installation of
one of these, pkgmk may exclaim the following: ".footprint mismatch"!
This is not something to be particularly worried over, because it is
likely that if you don't have gtk/qt3 installed, then the reason is
that you don't want gtk/qt3 to take up your hard drive space. :-)
