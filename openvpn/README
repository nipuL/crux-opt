REQUIREMENTS

OpenVPN requires the universal TUN/TAP driver in your kernel to function.

PRE-INSTALL

POST-INSTALL

This port is set to use static keys by default. You need to generate one 
by running:

openvpn --genkey --secret /etc/openvpn/openvpn.key

Edit /etc/openvpn/openvpn.conf to set up the IP addresses for the 
tunnel.

If you want to enable IP forwarding, use this command:

echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

PRECAUTION
