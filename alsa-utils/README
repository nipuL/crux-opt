In order to facilitate saving and restoring of soundcard mixer levels at
shutdown and boot, take these two methods as examples:


***NOTE***
BOTH methods require that you store your mixer levels beforehand, use
'/usr/sbin/alsactl store' first!
**********


Method 1: /etc/modprobe.conf

Add something like the following to /etc/modprobe.conf:

----
# ALSA mixer settings save/restore
install snd-emu10k1 /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install \
	snd-emu10k1 $CMDLINE_OPTS; /usr/sbin/alsactl restore
remove snd-emu10k1 /usr/sbin/alsactl store; /sbin/modprobe -r \
	--ignore-remove snd-emu10k1
----

(As with the other READMEs replace 'snd-emu10k1' with the correct
 soundcard module for your system.)

(On some hardware it seems the kernel module gets loaded but the
 soundcard isn't initialized in time for the modprobe.conf install
 command to succeed. If this is the case for your hardware, try
 method 2 instead.)


Method 2: /etc/rc.d/alsa init script

Add "alsa" to the SERVICES array in /etc/rc.conf.
