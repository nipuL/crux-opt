README file for qt-bluecurve-engine

This port is primary intended as a simple way to install
the QT bluecurve style for systems without kde.

post-install:
execute qtconfig as a user and add '/usr/lib/qt/plugins'
to the library path. Save and Exit, re-run qtconfig
and the bluecurve style should be available.

You may want to delete your previous ~/.qt/ dir BEFORE
this operation to let the default bluecurve colors take
effect.
