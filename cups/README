README for cups 1.3.x

REQUIREMENTS

1. This version of cups no longer includes a postscript interpreter. Install 
   the ghostscript port additionally.
2. In order to have more printer drivers available, the installation of the 
   gutenprint port (formerly gimp-print) is recommended. HP DeskJet/LaserJet 
   users should install the hpijs driver.
3. Build and install in the following order:
   - cups
   - gutenprint (optionally)
   - ghostscript
   - foomatic-filters (optionally)
   - hpijs (optionally)

Most common printers should be supported by the above configuration, if 
NOT you must have foomatic-filters installed and must generate a PPD file 
(Postscript Printer Description) for your printer:

1. Select your printer from http://www.linuxprinting.org/printer_list.cgi
2. Select a driver, be shure the driver is available within ghostscript.
   You can see all drivers included in ghostscript with a 'gs -h'.
3. Download the PPD file for your printer.
4. Save the PPD file to /usr/share/cups/model/<name>.
5. Restart cups with '/etc/rc.d/cups restart'


PRE-INSTALL

1. Remove a installed lprng package.
   Cups and lprng cannot be installed together.
