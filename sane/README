README for sane 1.0.x

REQUIREMENTS

PRE-INSTALL

POST-INSTALL

  1. If you're using an USB scanner, create the group 'scanner' and 
     add all users which need access to your device.

  2. To find the vendor/product id of your scanner, run the command:

     # sane-find-scanner -q
     found USB scanner (vendor=0x04a9 [Canon], product=0x2204 [CanoScan] at libusb:002:002

     You need the 'vendor' id (0x04a9) and the 'product' id (0x2204)

  3. Check if /etc/hotplug/usb/libsane.usermap already knows about 
     your scanner. If your scanner is not in this list, add a line 
     like the following, remember to replace 0x04a9 and 0x2204 with 
     your values:

     libusbscanner   0x0003  0x04a9  0x2204  0x0000  0x0000  0x00  0x00 0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00000000

  4. Check the file permissions in /proc/bus/usb after you have plugged 
     in your scanner device.

     # ls -l /proc/bus/usb/001
     total 0
     -rw-r--r--  1 root root    43 Aug  3 10:58 001
     -rw-rw----  1 root scanner 50 Aug  3 10:58 005
