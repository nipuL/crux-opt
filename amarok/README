Dependencies:

kdelibs            (required)
kdebase            (recommended)
    * adds embedded filemanager lets one browse the filesystem
      this makes manual addition of music fast and easy.  If
      kdebase is installed, one can also drag and drop from a
      normal konqueror window, to various fields in Amarok, to
      do different actions.

xine-lib           (recommended)
    * Xine is faster then GStreamer.  Amarok's graphic equalizer, and other
      visualizations, are tuned to Xine for low-latency.  As GStreamer
      isn't part of CRUX anymore, this is the only stable engine
      available to CRUX users.

ruby               (recommended)
    * many amaroK scripts are written in Ruby, therefore Ruby is useful
      for extending amaroK's usefulness

k3b                (optional)
    * needed for integrated cd-burning
