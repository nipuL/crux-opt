Dependencies:

kdelibs            (required)
kdebase            (recommended)
    * adds embedded filemanager lets one browse the filesystem
      this makes manual addition of music fast and easy.  If
      kdebase is installed, one can also drag and drop from a
      normal konqueror window, to various fields in Amarok, to
      do different actions.

xine-lib           (recommended)
    * Xine is faster then GStreamer.  Amarok's graphic equalizer, and other
      visualizations, are tuned to Xine for low-latency.

AND/OR

gst-plugins        (optional)
    * Use GStreamer instead of Xine, if desired.  Personally, I find
      that Xine is faster and more stable.

libvisual-plugins  (optional)
    * LibVisual provides audio visualization support.  Very nice eye candy!

k3b                (optional)
    * needed for cd-burning integration
