REQUIREMENTS

PRE-INSTALL

POST-INSTALL

In order to use the QEMU Accelerator Module, first enable /dev/shm in
/etc/fstab. This is the area kqemu uses for the virtual machine RAM.

When using udev, the device node is created automatically; add the following to
/etc/udev/rules.d/10-custom.rules to allow all users of group 'qemu' to use
kqemu:

  KERNEL="kqemu", MODE="0660", GROUP="qemu"

Loading the kqemu kernel module is done with "modprobe kqemu major=0" This will
cause the major number to be assigned dynamically.

PRECAUTION
