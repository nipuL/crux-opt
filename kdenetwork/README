POST-INSTALL

/etc/rc.d/lisa starts LISa, the LAN Information Server.

LISa is intended to provide a kind of "network neighborhood" but only relying on the TCP/IP protocol stack, no smb or whatever.

You'll need to run kcontrol -> Internet & Network -> Local Network Browing.
/etc/rc.d/lisa start, and network browing is go!
