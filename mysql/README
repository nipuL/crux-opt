README for mysql 5.0.xx

REQUIREMENTS

PRE-INSTALL

POST-INSTALL
1. run 'mysql_install_db' to build the system database
   in /var/lib/mysql
2. run 'mysql_upgrade' to add new privileges and features 
   to the MySQL privilege tables if you have 4.x or 3.x 
   databases
3. Set a password for the mysql root user:
   mysqladmin -u root password <mysql_root_password>

PRECAUTION
1. With the default configuration networking support for 
   mysql is disabled, meaning the mysql daemon is accessable 
   from localhost only. 
   To add networking support comment out the 'skip-networking' 
   line in /etc/my.cnf. 
2. If you upgrade from mysql 4.0.x you must recompile the 
   other packages on your system that are linked against the 
   mysql client libraries (libmysqlclient). 
   To obtain such a list of packages for your system, you 
   may use the command 'prt-get dependent mysql' or use yapo 
   to list the packages.

INNODB
  InnoDB table type support is compiled in but disabled by
  default. Comment out the skip-innodb line in /etc/my.cnf
  to fully enable InnoDB support.
