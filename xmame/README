README for xmame 0.99+


REQUIREMENTS


OPTIONAL

    Although xmame compiles without libsdl, it's
    recommended that you install it before compiling.

    The port tries to check what soundsystem is in use
    by checking what soundsystems are available.
    This may or may not work, please mail about bugs.


PRE-INSTALL

    xmame benefits from some mad CFLAGS ;)
    do 'man gcc' for details


POST-INSTALL


PRECAUTION
