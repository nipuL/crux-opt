README for wpa_supplicant


REQUIREMENTS

Kernel driver for your wireless card, e.g. ndiswrapper or ipw2100. 
See the wpa_supplicant homepage for supported drivers.


PRE-INSTALL


POST-INSTALL

1. Create a network setup for wpa_supplicant:

   wpa_passphrase <ssid> <your_secret> >> /etc/wpa.conf

   See the sample configuration file wpa_supplicant.conf in the
   sources for a complete description of the available options 
   for wpa_supplicant. 

2. Change your wlan start script to use wpa_supplicant.

   Following an example for the centrino ipw2100 driver, no need 
   to do anything with iwconfig:

   /sbin/modprobe ipw2100
   /sbin/ifconfig eth1 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx netmask 255.255.255.xxx
   /sbin/route add default gw xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
   /usr/sbin/wpa_supplicant -B -Dwext -ieth1 -c/etc/wpa.conf

   Note: the above configuration makes use of the generic wext
         wpa_supplicant driver (Linux wireless extensions), 
         which is the preferred nowadays. Use this driver for
         ndiswrapper as well.


PRECAUTION

As off version 0.6.8 the -w option of wpa_supplicant was removed.
See the ChangeLog for more infos. This may cause troubles because
using the -w option was the recommend way to start wpa_supplicant
until version 0.6.
