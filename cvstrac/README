README for cvstrac 1.2.x

As of version 1.2 cvstrac supports subversion and cvs as 
SCM backends. Git is possible as well, but untested by me. 

To use cvstrac for a subversion repository just call it as 
/usr/bin/svntrac, which is a symlink to cvstrac. See also 
/etc/rc.d/cvstrac and /var/www/cgi-bin/cvstrac.cgi.
