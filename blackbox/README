I merged window snapping changes from 0.70.1 (considering the frequency of
blackbox releases in the past, this seemed legitimate ;-)). To use it, add the
following to your ~/.blackboxrc:

  session.windowSnapThreshold: 10

replace 10 with your snap threshold of choice


Random notes on blackbox 0.70

- the style format changed; to use pre 0.70 styles, convert them using
  'bstyleconvert'
- you need bbkeys >= 0.9.0beta1 (just use contrib/bbkeys)
- the old default styles (artwiz et al) are not included in the default
  installation; they're still included in the source tarball if you want
  them
- at the time of writing this, there's no working release for bbpager
  yet; you can either use bbpager CVS, or any EWMH compatible pager
