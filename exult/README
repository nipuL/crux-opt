README for exult 1.2


REQUIREMENTS
1. Copies of Ultima 7: The Black Gate and/or Ultima 7: Serpent Isle.


PRE-INSTALL
   

POST-INSTALL
1. locate the 'static' folder from either of your Ultima 7 installations 
   and copy them in seperate directories (eg: /usr/share/exult/blackgate/static).

2. Run exult once to generate a default config file (~/.exult.cfg)

3. Make sure the path for each game points directly above from where the
   static directory is held. For example: if the static directory for
   'The Black Gate' is located in /usr/share/exult/blackgate/static the
   path in your ~/.exult.cfg would be:

---------<snip>----------
   <blackgate>
    <path>
    /usr/share/exult/blackgate/
    </path>
    ...
   </blackgate>
---------<snip>----------

4. Edit ~/.exult.cfg and make sure the relavant lines are inserted 
   as shown below:

---------<snip>----------
   <blackgate>
    ...
    <waves>
    jmsfx.flx
    </waves>
    ...
   </blackgate>
---------<snip>----------

---------<snip>----------
   <serpentisle>
    ...
    <waves>
    jmsisfx.flx
    </waves>
    ...
   </serpentisle>  
---------<snip>----------

5. Make sure the sound driver is set to 'digital' from the ingame menu.

6. If you want the OGG encoded music for Exult, install 'exult-musicpack' port.


PRECAUTION
1. Do not mix static directories from both games, either games must have
   their own directories.
