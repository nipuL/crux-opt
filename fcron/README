README for fcron 3.x

REQUIREMENTS

PRE/POST-INSTALL

1. Create a user/group fcron with a unused id < 99:

   'groupadd -g 45 fcron'
   'useradd -u 45 -g fcron -d /var/spool/fcron -s /bin/false fcron'
   'passwd -l fcron'

PRECAUTION

   As of version 3.0.4 release 2 frcon is configured to use a 
   user and group fcron instead of daemon/daemon. 
   If you upgrade fcron you have to run rejmerge to get the right
   owner for the files in /etc/fcron and manually adjust the owner
   and group of /var/spool/fcron to fcron.
