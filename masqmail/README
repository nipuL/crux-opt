README for masqmail 0.2.x

REQUIREMENTS

PRE-INSTALL
1. Remove sendmail. Masqmail and sendmail can not coexist.
      
POST-INSTALL
1. Check /etc/masqmail/masqmail.conf for correct values for
   your host/domain. 
2. Now masqmail delivers all non-local mail directly to the 
   mail server of the recipient. To use the mail server of
   your provider for delivering mail, edit inet.route.
3. In this configuration masqmail doesn't take care about
   your online status. See masqmail.conf(5) about online
   detection.
 
PRECAUTION
   As of version 0.2.21 the masqmail log files must be 
   writeable by the system-user 'mail'. 
   
     chown mail:mail /var/log/masqmail/*
