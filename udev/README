README for udev


The information formerly in this README is now available in the
devfs_to_udev_README file located in this directory.

This version of the udev port uses a modified gentoo start_udev
script and a slightly modified gentoo udev.rules file. The reason
for this is simply that I wish to spend less time maintaining
them and the gentoo people are doing a great job there. The
previous crux rules file is available in this directory as
crux-udev.rules but isn't installed with the port.

------------------------------------------------------------------
*IMPORTANT* - I don't intend to support the devfs-style names
forever. I've already removed the ide-devfs and scsi-devfs scripts
from the udev port. You'll need to edit your fstab and such to
reflect this if you use the devfs-style names. Eventally this
will also affect logins as /etc/inittab and /etc/securetty use
devfs-style vc/* notation, which needs to be changed to tty*. This
release contains legacy vc/* symlinks but this will change in the
future.
------------------------------------------------------------------

As a side note, I recommend a slightly different /etc/rc setup
than the original README. The appropriate sections look like this:

--------------------------------
# Start udev
/bin/mount -n -t proc none /proc
/bin/mount -n -t sysfs none /sys
/sbin/start_udev
--------------------------------

--------------------------------
# Mount local filesystems
/bin/mount -n -o remount,rw /
/bin/umount /sys /proc
/bin/rm -f /etc/mtab*
/bin/mount -a -O no_netdev
--------------------------------

This depends on your system having lines for /sys and /proc in
the fstab file, unlike the original README, but it cleans up
mount/mtab info. For reference, I use the following lines in
/etc/fstab:

none /proc proc defaults 0 0
none /sys sysfs defaults 0 0
