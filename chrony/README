README for chrony 1.20

REQUIREMENTS

PRE-INSTALL

POST-INSTALL

Add up to eight time server of your country to /etc/chrony.conf.
A list of public servers can be found here:

  http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/clock1a.html
  http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/clock2a.html


PRECAUTION

Remove the both '/sbin/hwclock ...' entries from /etc/rc.shutdown 
and /etc/rc. No other software should manipulate the system hardware 
clock if chronyd is running.


Chrony is a pure Network time protocol (NTP) server, that mean it
provides it's services on port 123/UDP. Utilities like rdate uses
the time protocol on port 37/TCP. To use rdate with chrony you must 
add the following line to the /etc/inetd.conf of your chrony server 
and run inetd:

  time   stream   tcp   nowait   root   internal

To avoid this, I recommend the use of the NTP utility msntp to sync 
your clients with your chrony server or better run chrony on all of 
your clients. 

The start script /etc/rc.d/chronyd has a online and a offline option. 
Use this in your ip-up/ip-down scripts to tell chrony whether we are 
online or offline.
