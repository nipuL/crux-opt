IMPORTANT

the PKGREPO file format chaged a bit from 0.3.3,
please regenerate your repositories with pkg-repgen

the /etc/pkg-get.conf options slightly changed
in version 0.3.0 in order to handle multiple
repositories.

pkg-get is beta software. I did not have much
time to test it, expecially latest features
added (locking, pre-post install scripts, printf).

Comments and contributions are welcome.
