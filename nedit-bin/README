This is the binary port for nedit,
statically linked with the motif toolkit.

I prefer this one both  for aesthtical reasons, see
http://www.nr.no/~joachim/nedit_looks.html

and because in some low-end machine it's
good to have a standalone X11 editor available without
to install other libs (lesstif in case of the
nedit source port)
