README for openntpd

openntpd expects to have a user and group dedicated to it. By default, _ntp. To
create them, use the following or similar commands, edited to your needs.

	# groupadd -g 83 _ntp
	# useradd -g _ntp -u 83 -c "NTP Daemon" -d /var/empty -s /bin/false _ntp

*NOTE*

	A post-install script has been added to the port which takes care of the
	above.
