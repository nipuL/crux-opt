REQUIREMENTS

PRE-INSTALL

POST-INSTALL

    Create the necessary user 'ntp' and its group 'ntp'.

	groupadd ntp
	useradd -g ntp -d /var/empty -s /bin/false ntp
	passwd -l ntp

MISCELLANEOUS

    Have a look at the start/stop script if you don't like ntpd setting
    the time immediately at startup. That allows for a large time
    correction. Disable that feature by removing the '-s' option.
