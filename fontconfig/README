POST-INSTALL

  After upgrading fontconfig, always run rejmerge and upgrade
  /etc/fonts.conf and /etc/fonts.dtd.


  /etc/fonts/conf.avail ships with configuration snippets that can be
  symlinked from /etc/fonts/conf.d to enable them.
  It's recommended to use these snippets instead of duplicating XML code
  in your /etc/fonts/local.conf.

  For more information on conf.avail/conf.d, please see:
