PRE-INSTALL

    Kernel sources must exist in /usr/src/linux[-version]

	Note that this port does not provide a .md5sum, as it is built from
	a daily svn snapshot of madwifi-ng.

POST-INSTALL

	Run depmod -a, edit /etc/modprobe.conf and /etc/rc.d/net.  The module 
	name is ath_hal or ath_pci, depending on your card.  The wireless 
	ifdevice name is ath0.  Something like this should work:

	/etc/modprobe.conf:
	alias ath0 ath_pci

	/etc/rc.d/net:
	wlanconfig ath0 create wlandev wifi0 wlanmode sta

	The ath0 device may then be manipulated with ifconfig or dhcpcd.
