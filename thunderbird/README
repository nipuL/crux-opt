*** PROFILE/STARTUP ISSUES ***

If thunderbird seems to hang when first started, close it and re-run it
with the -ProfileManager option; create a new profile, then exit. Copy
ImapMail, Mail, and prefs.js (if they all exist; if not, copy the ones that
do) to the new profile and use that. Delete the old profile once you're
satisfied that the new one works correctly.

The extensions problem shouldn't manifest itself if you encounter the
startup problem.

** EXTENSIONS ISSUES ***

The first time thunderbird 0.7.3/0.8/0.9/1.0 is run, any extensions in
the local user's extensions directory (typically
~/.thunderbird/default.XXX/extensions) are disabled. You'll need to
remove the extensions directory, re-run thunderbird, and reinstall
them to get them working again if they're in the local user's extensions.
If they're system-wide extensions (such as enigmail) in /usr/lib/thunderbird,
reinstallation isn't necessary, only removal of the local extensions
directory.

*** NOTE ***

Please note that if you wish to use any extensions after installation,
including enigmail built with the port, the above procedure (removing the
local user's extensions directory) MUST be performed even if no other
extensions are installed, and even if a new user profile is created.

************

Also, with 1.0.7, this can cause a segfault until the extensions directory
is removed.
