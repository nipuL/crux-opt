PRECAUTION

    If you don't remove libpcre before building this port libpcre will
    be a runtime dependency of zsh. This is a problem on systems where
    zsh needs to be available at boot before the directory containing
    libpcre.so is mounted. 

MISC
    zsh-lovers.1 is taken from http://www.grml.org/zsh/zsh-lovers.1
