REQUIREMENTS

    This port depends on the pcre regular expression library called
    libpcre. 

PRE-INSTALL

POST-INSTALL

PRECAUTION

    Due to the fact that this port compiles the libpcre into the shell
    it's a runtime dependency of zsh. This is a problem on systems where
    zsh needs to be available at boot before the directory containing
    libpcre.so is mounted. 

    If you don't like this library edit the Pkgfile and remove the line
    containing the configure parameter: "--enable-pcre".
