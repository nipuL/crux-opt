REQUIREMENTS

  To watch many of the new Quicktime trailers, you'll need to
  install:

    - libsndfile
    - lame
    - id3lib
    - faad2
    - faac
    - liba52

  You should then recompile and upgrade mplayer, so that it is
  built with support for these codecs.

  To watch videos on sites that only support IE you need to
  install the following Firefox extension:

  http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mplayerplug-in/mplayerplug-in-0.4.xpi?download

  It works by converting OBJECT tags to EMBED ones.
