REQUIREMENTS

PRE-INSTALL

POST-INSTALL
1. To activate the required services add some of the following lines to 
   /etc/inetd.conf:

    pop2   stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/sbin/tcpd  ipop2d
    pop3   stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/sbin/tcpd  ipop3d
    imap   stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/sbin/tcpd  imapd
    pop3s  stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/sbin/tcpd  ipop3d
    imaps  stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/sbin/tcpd  imapd

   For security reasons it's highly recommended to use the ssl encrypted 
   services pop3s and imaps whenever possible.

2. Create two self-signed certificates for the imap and pop3 daemons:

   openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out imapd.pem -keyout imapd.pem
   openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out ipop3d.pem -keyout ipop3d.pem
   mv imapd.pem ipop3d.pem /etc/ssl/certs
   chmod 0600 /etc/ssl/certs/{imapd.pem,ipop3d.pem}
