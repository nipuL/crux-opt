WARNING:

This version of the port is incompatible with the previous ones, so 
please make sure you don't have any 
  export CC=/usr/bin/ccache-gcc 
or
  export CXX=/usr/bin/ccache-g++
in your startup/configuration files; this will make compilations fail.


POSTINSTALL
To use ccache, prepend /usr/lib/ccache to your $PATH environment variable.

You might also want to change the ccache directory, using the CCACHE_DIR 
environement variable, or by using symlinks (I have created a /ccache 
directory, and make $HOME/.ccache point to /ccache for those users who
want to use the shared cache)
