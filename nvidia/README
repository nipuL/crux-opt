README for nvidia 1.0-8178+


***** NOTE for users of NV2X chipsets!!! *****

*** NOTE for nvidia with udev ***

If using udev, add your user to the "video" group to be able to
use the nvidia devices required for 3d to function properly.


POST-INSTALL

Use opt/gl-select from ports to select the correct gl/glx
libraries and extensions like so:

	# gl-select nvidia


POST-REMOVE

Use opt/gl-select from ports to revert to the x11 gl/glx libraries
and extensions like so:

	# gl-select x11


When UPGRADING/DOWNGRADING the nvidia port (where the version changes),
use gl-select to revert to x11 and then re-select nvidia in order to
refresh the libGLcore and libGL symlinks, like so:

	# prt-get update nvidia
	# gl-select x11; gl-select nvidia


nvhelper.sh is still included in the port for the time being but
gl-select is the preferred method.
