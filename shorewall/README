POST-UPGRADE

You may wish to periodically:

sudo diff -ur /etc/shorewall /var/lib/pkg/rejected/etc/shorewall

in order to track upstream shorewall configuration changes.  Although
I have not yet encountered a minor version release of shorewall which
broke compatibility with my /etc/shorewall configuration, it is
something worth being aware of.  If shorewall fails to start due to a
configuration error, DON'T PANIC! ;-)
