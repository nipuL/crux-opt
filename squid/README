README for squid 2.5

REQUIREMENTS

PRE-INSTALL
1. Create user/group squid with a unused id < 99:
   'groupadd -g 20 squid'
   'useradd -g squid -u 20 -d /var/squid -s /bin/false squid'
   'passwd -l squid'
   
POST-INSTALL
1. run '/usr/sbin/squid -z' to build the cache structure

PRECAUTION
1. all directories used by squid must be chown to 
   squid.squid or to the effective cache user/group defined 
   in squid.conf
2. With version 2.5 the location of the squid executable has 
   changed from /usr/bin to /usr/sbin. Don't reject the new
   startscript /etc/rc.d/squid.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
There are many other configuration options for squid. This
port should be a very basic one, read the docs for the more 
advanced options. George Adamopoulos sent me an email with
some suggestions, which I'll not include in the port, but
put here because of his useful comments:

--enable-delay-pools
  Enable delay pools to limit bandwidth usage. You need to 
  enable the option in order to use Squid to limit bandwith 
  usage. It will give fair bandwith usage for everybody. 
  In my case, I don't want one person sucking all of the 
  available bandwidth by downloading a big movie, causing 
  others to suffer.

--enable-storeio=diskd,ufs
  Enable diskd. Improve disk I/O performance. According to 
  the Squid FAQ, if you enable diskd you can gain a 400% 
  increase of perfomance. However, you would need to 
  recompile the kernel because your operating system must 
  support message queues and shared memory.

--enable-removal-policies
  Build support for the list of removal policies. 
  By default, Squid uses LRU, but there are two better 
  policies: GDSF and LFUDA. See the Squid config for a more 
  detailed explanation.

--disable-ident-lookups
  Removes code that performs Ident (RFC 931) lookups. 
  Not really important. By the way, if you do transparent 
  proxy, ident lookups won't work.

--enable-snmp
  You can monitor Squid with mrtg or rrdtool.
