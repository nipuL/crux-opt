README for hotplug


If you need coldplugging support (modules loaded for devices that were present
at boot-time that would normally be hotplugged), install coldplug and add
"coldplug" to the SERVICES array in /etc/rc.conf. This port no longer has
an init script so it's safe to remove "hotplug" from SERVICES.
