README for xpdf

Ghostscript is an optional dependency for xpdf.  To use ghostscript
fonts in xpdf uncomment the lines beginning with '#displayFontT1'
in /etc/xpdfrc.

You can also specify additional font mappings and use TrueType fonts
(again, see /etc/xpdfrc)

Thanks to Clare Johnstone for the tip.
