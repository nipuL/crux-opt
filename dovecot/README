README for dovecot 1.0.x

REQUIREMENTS

PRE-INSTALL
   Create a user/group dovecot with a unused id < 99:
   'groupadd -g 26 dovecot'
   'useradd -g dovecot -u 26 -d /var/run/dovecot -s /bin/false dovecot'
   'passwd -l dovecot'
   
POST-INSTALL

PRECAUTION
   The configuration file has had a lot of changes between 0.99 and 1.0, 
   so it's better to just modify the included dovecot.conf file manually
   than to update the existing one.
