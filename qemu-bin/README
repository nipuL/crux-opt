README file for qemu-bin port

WHY?
  Qemu currently does not correctly work well if compiled with
  gcc 4. There are patches around (see the qemu port) but some
  things are still broken (ie: tun-tap networking).

NOTE
  This binary port install support files in /usr/local,
  a small price to pay until qemu get official support
  for gcc 4.
