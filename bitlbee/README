REQUIREMENTS

PRE-INSTALL

Run the pre-install script with "sh pre-install" to create the 'bitlbee'
user and group.

POST-INSTALL

Add the following to /etc/inetd.conf:

ircd		stream	tcp	nowait	bitlbee	/usr/sbin/bitlbee bitlbee

Start or restart inetd. Now you should be able to connect 127.0.0.1:6667
with your IRC client. You might want to add inetd to the SERVICES array
in /etc/rc.conf and set up a firewall or modify /etc/hosts.deny to stop 
outsiders from accessing your BitlBee gateway.

PRECAUTION
