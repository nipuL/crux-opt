README for DirectFB 0.9.20

By default, DirectFB is built without support for the
multi application core. To enable the multi application core,
you'll have to

* apply the Fusion device kernel patch (included in the
  DirectFB tarball in patches/)
* copy /usr/src/linux-version/include/linux/fusion.h to /usr/include/linux
* uncomment the line saying '# EXTRA_ARGS="--enable-multi"' in Pkgfile
