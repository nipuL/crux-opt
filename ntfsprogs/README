PRE-INSTALL

Build FUSE support into your kernel either statically, or as a module.
If you build it as a module, be sure to load the module before
building ntfsprogs.
Install fuse from CRUX ports.

ntfsprogs is now ready to be installed


POST-INSTALL

Wiki.linux-ntfs.org suggests adding the following line to fstab:
/dev/hda1 /mnt/c ntfs-fuse fmask=0111,dmask=0,succeed_chmod 0 0

This is what I use:
/dev/hda3 /mnt/other ntfs-fuse \
          user,noauto,gid=10,umask=0007,fmask=0117,succeed_chmod 0 0


NOTES

ntfsmount is very CPU intensive!
